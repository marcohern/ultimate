<h2>Our most powerful noise cancelling headphones yet</h2>
<p>QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II are the best from Bose. They’re engineered with world-class noise cancellation and direct access to Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant for simple voice control on the go. Your music. Your voice. You’re in control.</p>
<h2>Focus. On.</h2>
<p>What happens when you clear away the noisy distractions of the world? Concentration goes to the next level. You get deeper into your music, your work, or whatever you want to focus on. That’s the power of QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II. Put them on and get closer to what you’re most passionate about. Proprietary technology continuously monitors and measures outside noise and then cancels it with the opposite signal. But we didn’t stop there. You can also adjust the level of noise cancelling between three levels to better fit your environment. So you can focus — really focus — on what matters.</p>
<h3>BOSE + VOICE</h3>
<h2>Now you’re talking</h2>
<p>QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II are optimized for Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant. That means you can enjoy entertainment, get information, and manage your day — all with your voice. Whichever you choose, you’re covered. Just press and hold the Action button for help. And they still feature our world-class noise cancelling technology that blocks noise and lets you lose yourself in your music.</p>
<h3>NO VOICE ASSISTANT? NO PROBLEM.</h3>
<p>If you’re not an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant user, don’t worry. You can still use the Action button to adjust your level of noise cancellation between three settings.</p>
<h3>BUILT BETTER</h3>
<p>When you want to take your music anywhere, you need headphones built to keep up. With impact-resistant materials, glass-filled nylon, and corrosion-resistant stainless steel, they’re engineered to survive life on the go. But when you take them everywhere and listen all day, they have to be comfortable, too. That’s why the QC35 headband isn’t just soft, it’s luxurious. Wrapped in Alcantara® — the soft covering material used in yachts and high-end automobiles — it provides a welcome comfort designed for all-day listening. And the plush ear cushions are manufactured from a synthetic protein leather, so it won’t even feel like you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<h3>5 PARTS | 26 COLORS | 2 FINISHES</h3>
<h2>Nearly limitless combinations, all yours to create</h2>
<p>5 different parts to customize. 26 total colors. High-gloss and premium metal finishes. That means there are nearly limitless designs you can come up with. Seriously—there are over 5 million ways to give your world-class headphones your own style. And these are still Bose headphones, so you know the finish is durable and has passed our strictest tests. We use high-quality, automotive-grade paint and color each piece of the headphones individually to make a truly premium custom coating.</p>
<h2>20 Hours battery life</h2>
<p>Enjoy up to 20 hours of listening, enough time to pore through this entire playlist. So you can keep the music — or the quiet — going all day long. And when it finally runs down, a quick 15-minute charge gives you another 2.5 hours. For that rare time when you do get caught without battery, use the included cable to plug in and keep the music playing.</p>
<h2>ASTONISHING SOUND AT ANY VOLUME</h2>
<p>You want fullness and clarity for your music, regardless of how loud it gets. That’s why our drivers feature volume-optimized EQ for even better performance than before. Get clear, balanced audio performance at any volume, and a noise-rejecting dual microphone system provides clearer calls, even in noisy environments. So, when you’re playing at low volumes in a quiet office, you get the same, consistent quality as when you need to turn it up on a busy street.</p>
<h2>A few ice breakers…</h2>
<p>Using your voice is easy. Just ask Alexa or the Google Assistant to help you get home, add something to your to-do list, check the weather, and so much more — all without glancing at your phone. Explore a few common commands.</p>
<h2>One app. Complete control.</h2>
<p>The Bose Connect app gives you easy access to everything your product has to offer. Get tips, unlock product features and personalize your settings, so you can spend more time enjoying the music instead of setting it up.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in an airport or a library, you can also choose just how much you want to hear (or don’t) by adjusting the levels of noise cancellation. And remember, sharing is caring. You can connect two wireless Bose headphones, so you and your friend can listen to the same thing at the same time. Hope you have a good playlist lined up.</p>
